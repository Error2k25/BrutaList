# 🧠 BrutaList 🔓 Not Just Brute. Brutal. ⚔️  
Welcome to BrutaList — the cyber crowbar for cracking chaos.  
BrutaList is a weaponized wordlist generator built for hackers who don’t ask permission. 🚫  

You throw in characters — it returns every possible valid permutation, filtered by logic and forged in entropy. 🛠️

No bloat. No guesswork. Just raw, optimized brute-force ammo. ⚡
